//007 â€“ Day 7: closures part two
//1. Using closures as parameters when they accept parameters

func travel(action: (String) -> Void) {
    print("I'm getting ready to go.")
    action("London")
    print("I arrived!")
}

travel { (pl: String) in
    print("I'm going to \(pl) in my car")
}


let changeSpeed = { (speed: Int) in
    print("Changing speed to \(speed)kph")
}

func buildCar(name: String, engine: (Int) -> Void) {
    // build the car
}

//2.Using closures as parameters when they return values

func travel1(action: (String) -> String) {
    print("I'm getting ready to go.")
    let description = action("London")
    print(description)
    print("I arrived!")
}

travel1 { (place: String) -> String in
    return "I'm going to \(place) in my car"
}
